Team 7: Function SDK Core Logic


Description of the technology we are planning to use to build our APIs:

We will be using Python as the primary language for building our APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and vast libraries that support rapid development. Additionally, we are implementing gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) to enable efficient communication between our services. gRPC provides high performance with low latency, ideal for our distributed system architecture, and supports multiple languages, which ensures compatibility across diverse platforms.


List of assignments for everyone in our team:

We have divided the API development tasks among the team members. Each member will be responsible for building and maintaining specific API endpoints, ensuring clear ownership and accountability:

Dominic Attalienti:
  API 1: Register Function Command
  API 5: Set Function Environment Variables Command
  API 9: Invoke Function Asynchronously

Eric Cacdac: 
  API 3: Invoke Registered Function Command
  API 8: Invoke Function with Retry Command
  API 11: Get Function Result

Maryam Majid: 
  API 4: Set Function Timeout Command
  API 7: Handle Function Errors Command
  API 10: Check Function Status

Sofia Usmani: 
  Project Management
  API 2: Deregister Function Command
  API 6: Retrieve Function Logs Command
